# MIPS-string-formatting
Simple string formatting in MIPS. More in README

ukol2.s
As said above. Is a simple program which prompts the user to add a string and then modify it
with the use of instructions d and i. <br\>
Instruction d\<position\> - deletes char at \<position\>. <br\>
Instruction i\<position\>\<char\> - inserts \<char\> at \<position\>. <br\>
!! \<position\> is an index of said char! not its number. <br\>
i.e. input = "hello" <br\>
instr: d1 -> "hllo" <br\>
instr: i1e -> "hello" <br\>



This program isn't completely fool proof and almost certainly has bugs and things to improve.
It was more or less my first time writing a program in assembly and it probably looks that way.
There is probably a lot of improvements possible on the code, but maybe it can help another 
noob like me.

ukol1.circ
Is a circuit done in Logism. It only simulates simple 5 state automat.
It's just my backup for the whole subject so it's there.
